# SEP-Woodle
This project was a mock app designed in my 2nd year semester 2 software engineering practice module. It was created by Hasan Berk, James Demaine and I.

The repository contains a compressed file, downloaded directly from James Demaine's GitHub account, as well as unzipped .docx files
  showing our project in its various stages of completion.
  
The final product is not perfect as we didn't get time to finish adding the flowcharts/diagrams etc, but we still scored quite highly. ~75-80%
